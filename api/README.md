# API

This project involves building Python scripts to interact with a REST API that provides needed information. The scripts will gather data from the API, format it, and export it to CSV and JSON files.

## Requirements
- The scripts should be written in Python and follow PEP8 style guidelines.
- Python version 3.8.x should be used.
- Libraries such as urllib or requests can be utilized for API interaction.
- Data export to CSV and JSON should be implemented.
- Input validation for employee ID should be included.
- Detailed comments and documentation should be provided for clarity.

## Tasks Examples
1. **Gather data from an API**: Write a Python script that retrieves information about an employee's TODO list progress from a REST API. The script should accept an employee ID as a parameter and display the employee's TODO list progress in a specific format.

2. **Export to CSV**: Extend the Python script from task #1 to export the data in CSV format. The CSV file should contain records of tasks owned by the employee, with each record formatted as "USER_ID","USERNAME","TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS","TASK_TITLE".
